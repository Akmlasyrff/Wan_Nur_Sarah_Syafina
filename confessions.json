I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but I’ve been paying attention, not just to where you are, but to who you are.\n\nThere is something incredibly magnetic about your personality. It’s in the way you carry yourself and the genuine sincerity in your expressions. But what really stole my attention recently is seeing how much of a pet lover you are. As someone who loves animals deeply myself, watching the gentle way you interact with them tells me so much about your heart. There is a certain kindness in people who love animals, and seeing that side of you just makes me want to be around you even more. It’s rare to find someone who shares that same soft spot for them, and honestly, it’s one of the most attractive things about you.\n\nI find myself constantly wondering about the thoughts behind that smile. I love watching you when you are in your element, whether you are talking about something you love or just caring for a pet. I realized recently that knowing you 'a little bit' isn’t enough for me anymore. I have this strong feeling that there are so many layers to you, and I want to be the one who takes the time to discover them.\n\nI’m not asking for everything all at once. I just want the chance to be closer to you. I want to know the real Wan Nur Sarah Syafina, the person you are when you can truly be yourself.\n\nI really like the way you are, more than I probably show. If you are open to it, I would love the opportunity to get to know you better, properly.",
